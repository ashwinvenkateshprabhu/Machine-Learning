# Supervise Learning project

The purpose of this project is to explore some techniques in supervised learning. It is important to realize that understanding an algorithm or technique requires understanding how it behaves under a variety of circumstances. Objective is to implement some simple learning algorithms, and to compare their performance.

Implemented using R and Tableau.

Six supervised learning algorithms are implemented.
-> Decision trees
-> Neural networks
-> k Nearest neightbors
-> Boosting
-> Support vector machines
-> Naive bayes classification

### Data used is placed in the 'Data' folder. Make sure it is referenced properly before running the code.
